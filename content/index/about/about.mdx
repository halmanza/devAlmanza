### About Me

I'm currently a student at * Estrella Community Mountain College * and * Mesa Community College * in Arizona.

My current area of study is in Programming and System analysis (CCL), and my long-term goal
is to finish a bachelor's in computer science. 

I enjoy working with a variety of programming paradigms 
(functional, object-oriented), frameworks and libraries, ***but my main interest is in the intersection of design and logic. The tools are 
just a means to achieve the desired solution.***

Outside of web development, my free time is spent with my family, rock climbing, and enjoying various coffee shops. If you need any recommendations
for coffee or rock climbing in Arizona don't hesitate to ask!

***If your're looking for a developer that is energetic about learning, solving problems, and helping people
then I think I'd be a good fit for your firm. I look forward to talking to you!***

<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>

<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>React.JS</li>
<li>Gatsby</li>
<li>Java</li>
